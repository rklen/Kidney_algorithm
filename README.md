# Kidney_algorithm

This GitHub repository is related to an unpublished scientific manuscript titled “New 3D segmentation algorithm for modeling of kidney in positron emission tomography images” by Oona Rainio, Aino Latva-Rasku, Jussi Hirvonen, Juhani Knuuti, and Riku Klén.

The aim of the algorithm is to perform automatic segmentation of renal medulla and cortex in dynamic positron emission tomography images of humans without machine learning.

The algorithm was written in Python code. All the necessary functions can be found in the Jupyter notebook titled kid.ipynb. The code uses Python (version: 3.9.9), SciPy (version: 1.7.3), Rasterio (version: 1.3.11), and Shapely (version: 1.8.0). The original data cannot be made available due to privacy restrictions.

For more details, see the manuscript.
